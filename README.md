# John Lydrick Remitar — Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio site built with Next.js (App Router) and React.

Features
- Semantic HTML and pure CSS (no UI frameworks)
- Responsive (desktop / tablet / mobile)
- Accessible and SEO-friendly
- Smooth scrolling and active nav highlighting

Getting started

- Node.js 18+ installed

```powershell
cd C:\Users\johnlyd\remitarportfolio\remitarport
npm install
```

Run locally

```powershell
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Deploy

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Import the repository into Vercel (https://vercel.com) and set it to use the Root directory.
3. Vercel will detect Next.js and deploy automatically.

Notes
- The contact form is client-side only and does not submit to a backend. Integrate your preferred email/API for production.
- All styles are in `styles/globals.css` and small CSS modules.

Files of interest
- `app/layout.js` — site layout and global imports
- `app/page.js` — main page with sections
- `components/*` — reusable React components
- `styles/*` — CSS files

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a dedicated `/projects` route with detailed project pages
- Wire the contact form to an email service or API
